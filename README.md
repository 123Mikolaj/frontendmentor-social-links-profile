## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- CSS animations
- SVG filters for visual noise effects

### What I Learned

Through this project, I improved my ability to use semantic HTML5 elements for structuring web content. I also enhanced my CSS skills, focusing on:

- **Flexbox Layout:** Effective use of Flexbox for centering and aligning content.
- **CSS Animations:** Creating dynamic and interactive effects with CSS keyframes.
- **SVG Filters:** Applying SVG filters for background noise effects to add visual interest.
- **Tab Functionality:** I learned how important semantic HTML is for enabling tab functionality and ensuring that interactive elements are accessible to all users.

### Continued Development

For future projects, I plan to:

- Experiment more with noise and animations.

### Useful Resources and Inspirations

- **[Juxtopposed - Creating Noise Effects with SVG Filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZFghigBmqo&ab_channel=Juxtopposed)**: This YouTube video was a major inspiration for incorporating noise effects into my project. It provided valuable insights on using SVG filters to create visually engaging background textures.
